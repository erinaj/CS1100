Step 1:
Variables and values
My byte variable bt is = 12
My short variable s is = 8
My int variable i is = 10
My long variable l is = 100
My float variable f is = 2.0
My double variable dbl is = 10.0
My boolean variable bln is = true
My char variable ch is = A

New variables and values:
My new byte variable bt is = 6
My new short variable s is = 3
My new int variable i is = 5
My new long variable l is = 50
My new float variable f is = 9.0
My new double variable dbl is = 3.0
My new boolean variable bln is = false
My new char variable ch is = B

Constants and values:
My byte constant bt1 is = 6
My short constant s1 is = 9
My int constant i1 is = 14
My long constant l1 is = 21
My float constant f1 is = 6.0
My double constant dbl1 is = 8.0
My boolean constant bln1 is = true
My char constant ch1 is = C
When you try to assign a value to a constant you get an error message.

The smaller of the two numbers is 5

Step 4:
Number of Filled Jars: 7
The code tried to assign a double to an int so I had to assign the value to int instead.

Step 5:
3.5 yards are 10.5 feet
3.5 yards are 126.0 inches

Step 6:
The new value of x is 11
The new value of y is -2

Step 8:
average age: 36.75
The output of the following code is 36.0 even though the correct answer is 36.75.
This is because the initial values are integer types and will not deal with decimals.
Instead, it will print the whole number below.

Step 9:
The output is 869 because the computer outputs a decimal and does not know to round up to the correct number.
870

Step 10:
The outputString is Tempus fugit
